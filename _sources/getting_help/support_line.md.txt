# Support line

All support requests concerning the e-infrastructure resources should be sent to
[support@metacenter.no](mailto:support@metacenter.no).

Behind this address is an issue tracker (ticket system) and you will get an
automatic reply first and can expect response from our staff within hours
during normal work-hours, or at the latest the following working day (except
holidays).

When replying to email from the support line **please keep the ticket number** in
the subject line.

However, for a new problem, **do not reply to emails with unrelated subjects** (and
ticket numbers) as this can be confusing for us.


### Give enough information

We get many requests for help which are too vague to give a useful response.
So, when sending us a question, always answer these questions and you’ll get
the fastest useful response:

- **Has it ever worked?** (If so, what has changed?)
- **What are you trying to accomplish?** (Your ultimate goal, not current technical obstacle.)
- **What did you do?** (Be specific enough to be reproducible - copy and paste exact commands you run, scripts, inputs, output messages, etc.)

If you don’t know something, it’s OK, just do your best and we’ll help from
there! You can also chat with us to brainstorm about issues in general.

requests](how_to_write_good_support_requests.md) on how to report problems in
the most effective way for getting help quickly.
