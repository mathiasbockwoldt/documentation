## I forgot my password. How can I reset it?

Go to [this page](https://www.metacenter.no/user/reset/) and fill in your username.
An activation key will be sent to you to the mobile number associated with your username.

Note that it can take 15 minutes for the change to propagate to the login nodes (up to 1 hour on Vilje).

See also [this page](https://www.sigma2.no/how-reset-passwords) for a step by step guide, which also indicates
the times it takes for the change to take effect.

## I typed my password wrong several times. Now it seems I can not log in. Has my account been closed?

Your account is most likely not closed. To prevent brute-force attacks, our
