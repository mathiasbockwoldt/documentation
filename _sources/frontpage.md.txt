# The Norwegian Academic HPC Services

The Norwegian academic HPC infrastructure is maintained by the
[Sigma2 Metacenter](https://sigma2.no/metacenter), which is a
joint collaboration between
[UiO](https://www.uio.no), [UiB](https://www.uib.no), [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no),
[UiT](https://uit.no), and [UNINETT Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/).

This website (<https://documentation.sigma2.no/>) holds technical documentation about
the compute and storage resources. For more general information and service overview, please also see
<https://www.sigma2.no>.

**Latest news and announcements** are posted at
theÂ [Metacenter OpsLog](https://opslog.sigma2.no)
and the [@MetacenterOps](https://twitter.com/MetacenterOps) Twitter channel.

## Compute, storage, pre/post-processing, visualization, machine learning

We offer compute resources ([Betzy](hpc_machines/betzy.md),
[Fram](hpc_machines/fram.md), [Saga](hpc_machines/saga.md), and
[Stallo](https://hpc-uit.readthedocs.io)), storage resources
([NIRD](files_storage/nird.md)), as well as the [NIRD
Toolkit](https://www.sigma2.no/nird-toolkit) platform for pre- and post-processing
analysis, data intensive processing, visualization, artificial intelligence,
and machine learning.


## First time on a supercomputer?

Please read the **GETTING STARTED** section (left sidebar).  In the sidebar
overview you will also find technical details about the machines, instructions
for using installed software, for submitting jobs, storage, and code
development.

Please do not hesitate to write to [support@metacenter.no](mailto:support@metacenter.no)
if you find documentation sections which are
not clear enough or have suggestions for improvements. Such a feedback is very
important to us and will count.


## How to get the most out of your allocation

We want to support researchers in getting the most out of the high-performance
computing services.
When supporting users, we see that these problems are very frequent:
- **Reusing outdated scripts** from colleagues without adapting them to optimal
  parameters for the cluster at hand and thus leaving few cores idle.  Please
  check at least how many cores there are on a particular cluster node.
- **Requesting too much memory**
  which leads to longer queuing and less resource usage.
  Please check [how to choose memory settings](/jobs/choosing_memory_settings.md).
- Requesting **more cores than the application can effectively use** without
  studying the scaling of the application.  You will get charged more than
  needed and others cannot run jobs. If others do this, your own jobs queue.
- **Submitting jobs to the wrong queue** and then queuing longer than needed.
  Please take some time to study the different job types.

If you are unsure about these, please contact us via
[support@metacenter.no](mailto:support@metacenter.no) and we will help
you to use your allocated resources more efficiently so that you get your
research results faster.

## Acknowledging use of national HPC infrastructure

Projects are required to acknowledge the use of the national e-infrastructure
resources in their scientific publications. Papers, presentations and other
publications that feature work that relied on Sigma2 should include an
acknowledgement following this template:
```
The computations/simulations/[SIMILAR] were performed on resources provided by
UNINETT Sigma2 - the National Infrastructure for High Performance Computing and
Data Storage in Norway
```
