# Getting Started

This page lists information about how to get started with running applications
on the HPC machines.

## Getting Access

To gain access to the HPC machines, a formal application is needed. The process
is explained at our page for [how to apply for user
account](https://www.sigma2.no/how-apply-user-account).

## Logging In

Logging into the machine involves the use of Secure Shell (SSH) in a terminal.
SSH login is available natively to Linux or Mac OSX (or any UNIX-based systems).
On Windows machines an SSH client is needed, for example,
[PuTTY](http://putty.org).

```bash
$ ssh <username>@<machinename>
```

Replace `<username>` with your registered username and `<machinename>` with the
specific machine name.

The machine names are:

* `fram.sigma2.no` - Fram
* `saga.sigma2.no` - Saga
* `login.nird.sigma2.no` - NIRD. See [NIRD](../files_storage/nird.md) for more
  about NIRD.

First time you log in, and every time there is a change in the *ssh-server*, OS
or hardware on the system you log in to, you will be asked to confirm the
ssh-server fingerprint. Typical message is:

    The authenticity of host 'fram.sigma2.no (158.39.114.72)' can't be established.

The procedure then is to check the stated `ECDSA key fingerprint` with the one
printed here: [ssh SHA256 fingerprint](../faq/ssh.md#sha256-fingerprint).

If you are connecting from a laptop we recommend that you use
[Mosh](./create_ssh_keys.md#mosh).

## Remote desktop

The Fram, Saga and Stallo systems provides a remote desktop service. [See here
for tutorial and details.](remote-desktop.md)

**Quickstart**: Use a VNC client to log into `desktop.fram.sigma2.no:5901` or
`desktop.saga.sigma2.no:5901` (for information on Stallo see here
<http://stallo-gui.uit.no>). A web based remote desktop service is also
available <https://desktop.fram.sigma2.no:6080>. Access to these services are
blocked outside the Norwegian Research network, e.g. only accessible from
UNINETT and partner institutions. (workarounds are described in the
[tutorial](remote-desktop.md))

## Development environment

Abel, Stallo, Fram and Saga run CentOS Linux distributions as operating system.
The machines can run C/C++ or Fortran OpenMP and MPI applications, and depending
on the machine, various open-source and third party applications. The
Programming Environment page has more information about third-party
applications.

### Unix CLI

It is expected that the user is familiar with command-line interfaces (CLIs),
but for those who are not familiar with commands, the UiB and UiT pages have
several tutorials on the CLI environment:

* [Introduction to Unix CLI](https://docs.hpc.uib.no/wiki/Introduction_to_Unix_CLI) - UiB

To copy files from your machine to the HPC machines, use SSH File Transfer
Protocol (SFTP) or Secure Copy (SCP). They are available as command-line tools
for Linux and MacOS X but Windows users need to download a separate SCP or FTP
client, such as WinSCP.

For example, to copy projectfiles.tar.gz to the home directory of myusername to
Fram, type:

```bash
$ scp projectfiles.tar.gz myusername@fram.sigma2.no:
```

The [Transferring Files](/files_storage/file_transfer.md) page has more
information about transferring files to Fram.

### Modules
To keep track of the large number of different pieces of software that is
typically available on a shared HPC cluster, we use something called a software
module system. This allows us to have many different versions of compilers,
libraries and applications available for different users at the same time
without conflicting each other. By default when you log in to the cluster you
will get a clean environment with nothing but standard system compilers and
libraries. In order to make your favourite software application available to
you, you need to load its module into your environment, which is done using the
`module` command

    module [options] [module name]

Some of the more common options include:

* `avail` - list the available modules
* `list` - list the currently loaded modules
* `load <modulename>` - load the module called `modulename`
* `unload <modulename>` - unload the module called `modulename`
* `show <modulename>` - display configuration settings for `modulename`

More details on the module system, as well as a list of currently available
software modules, can be found in the [Software](/software/modulescheme.md)
section.

## Running Applications

The HPC machines provide compute nodes for executing applications. To ensure
fair access to the resources, the HPC machines run applications as _jobs_ in a
_queue system_, which schedules the tasks and process to run on compute nodes.
Abel, Stallo, and Fram use the Slurm queue system.

A job is described by a _batch script_, which is a shell script (a text file)
with `SBATCH` options to specify the needed resources and commands to perform
the calculations. All batch scripts must contain _at least_ the following
`SBATCH` options:

    #Project name
    #SBATCH --account=<project_name>

    #Max running time. The wall clock time helps the scheduler assess priorities and tasks.
    #SBATCH --time=<wall_clock_time>

To submit a job, use the `sbatch` command followed by the batch script's name:

    sbatch <scriptfile>

See the "JOBS" section in the menu for documentation about jobs and the queue
system.
