# Betzy

Named after [Mary Ann Elizabeth (Betzy) Stephansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Stephansen), the first Norwegian women to be awarded a doctorate degree.


### The most powerful supercomputer in Norway

Betzy is a BullSequana XH2000, provided by Atos, and will  give Norwegian researchers more than 5 times more capacity than previously, with a theoretical peak performance of 6.2  PetaFlops. The supercomputer, which will be placed at NTNU in Trondheim, will be available to users during the second half of 2020.

### No network access on compute nodes

According to our security policy, compute nodes shall not have direct access to
the public internet. This means that commands like `git clone` or `conda
install` or `pip install`, updating Git submodules, fetching data from web
sources, etc., will not work on compute nodes.
