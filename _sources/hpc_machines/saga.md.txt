# Saga
The supercomputer is named after the godess in norse mythology associated with wisdom. Saga is also a term for the Icelandic epic prose literature. The supercomputer, placed at NTNU in Trondheim, is designed to run workloads from Abel and Stallo. It was made available to users right before the start of the 2019.2 period (October 2019).

Saga is provided by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and has a computational capacity of approximately 85 million CPU hours a year and a life expectancy of four year, until 2023.

### No network access on compute nodes

According to our security policy, compute nodes shall not have direct access to
the public internet. This means that commands like `git clone` or `conda
install` or `pip install`, updating Git submodules, fetching data from web
sources, etc., will not work on compute nodes.
