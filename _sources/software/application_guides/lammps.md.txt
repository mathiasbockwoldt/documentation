# LAMMPS

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code, and an acronym for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator. LAMMPS has potentials for solid-state materials (metals, semiconductors) and soft matter (biomolecules, polymers) and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems.

It can be used to model atoms or, more generically, as a parallel particle simulator at the atomic, meso, or continuum scale.
LAMMPS runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain. The code is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new functionality.
LAMMPS is distributed as an open source code under the terms of the GPL.
