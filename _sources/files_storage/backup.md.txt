# Backup on Betzy, Fram, Saga, and NIRD

```{warning}
**Only home directories with enforced quotas are backed up**

Any \$HOME area using more then 20 GiB or more than 100000 files is
not backed up. To have your \$HOME backed up, you need to shrink the
disk usage below the 20 GiB limit *and* below 100000 files *and*
[notify support](/getting_help/support_line.html).

If "dusage" repots 0 Bytes limits, this means that you **do not have disk quotas**
activated and this means that these folders **are not backed up**.
```

```{warning}
**Betzy: NO BACKUP**

Backup on Betzy will be switched on **only** after the pilot period is
finished.
```


## Betzy, Fram and Saga

Home directories on Betzy, Fram and Saga (`/cluster/home/$USER`) are backed up
nightly to user's home directory on NIRD
(`/nird/home/$USER/backup/fram` or `/nird/home/$USER/backup/saga`).

`$HOME/nobackup` and `$HOME/tmp` directories are excluded from the backup.

The `nnXXXXk` project directories (`/cluster/projects/nnXXXXk`) are backed up
nightly to NIRD.

The shared areas in `/cluster/shared` **are not backed up** to NIRD.

The scratch areas in `/cluster/work/jobs` and `/cluster/work/users` **do not have any backup**.


## NIRD

Both home directories (`/nird/home/$USER`) and project areas (`/nird/projects/NSxxxxK`) have
backup in the form of snapshots and geo-replication.

Snapshots are taken with the following frequencies:
* `/nird/home/$HOME`:
  - daily snapshots for the last 7 days
  - weekly snapshots for the last 6 weeks
  - this also includes snapshots of the Betzy, Fram and Saga home directory backup
* `/nird/projects/NSxxxxK`:
  - daily snapshots for the last 7 days
  - weekly snapshots for the last 6 weeks

Snapshots are available at the following places:
- `/nird/home/u1/.snapshots`
- `/nird/projects/NSxxxxK/.snapshots`


## How to recover deleted/overwritten data

To recover a deleted or overwritten file `/nird/projects/NSxxxxK/dataset1/myfile`,
you can copy a snapshot back to the folder and restore the deleted/overwritten file:

```
$ cp /nird/projects/NSxxxxK/.snapshots/DATE/dataset1/myfile /nird/projects/NSxxxxK/dataset1/
```

Select the DATE accordingly to your case.

Similarly, a deleted/overwritten file in the home directory can be recovered like this:

```
$ cp /nird/home/u1/.snapshots/DATE/$USER/mydir/myfile /nird/home/$USER/mydir/
```

Note that snapshots are taken every night only. This means that deleted files
which did not exist yet yesterday cannot be recovered from snapshots.
